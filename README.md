#Quicket

Quicket is a way to share with those around you. Each post is tied to a latitude and longitude coordinate.

Random Thoughts:

University of Michigan specific social network (yik yak too general, "near south quad")

when users log in they join chat room of 'closest thing', (north quad, the rock, pierpont, etc)

Able to get within range and chat with the closest person online

Hops add the lat/lng of the hoppers location (bounce idea)

For everything you post or hop you can track where it went and what not (views, hops, etc all on a map ideally)

Two modes: 
| Quickets | Me |

Range bar at top (like Whisper)

Background a lightly faded map?
